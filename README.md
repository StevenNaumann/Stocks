# Stocks
Python software aimed at helping with information about stocks.

Not sure where this will end up, first I want to learn python. So I will
start with finding stock prices off of a website, then maybe start tracking/mapping
changes with that stock.

I was thinking tracking news of a company and mapping it with
the stocks movements would also be a idea for the future, maybe sending a notification email
if important news appears on websites (bad/good) based off of keywords. The email might
append a clip of the news and a link back to the story for further details. Possible start off the
news story searches based off of words related to the company, it's name, the name of the board
members, and maybe the names of their key products.
